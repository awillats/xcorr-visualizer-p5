![x]! try any reciprocal circuit!
  - may have to bound synaptic weights
  - found interesting results which depend strongly on reciprocal strength!
- [x] export circuit config as inline string! (see AdjMat)
  - [x] read graph parser in cviz 
      - [exportAdjMatToText(mat)](https://github.com/awillats/circuit-visualizer-p5/blob/1ef9d4fef6f7c2c1b969f6feb4bd9c4726d01e11/sketch.js#L455)
      - [parseTextToAdj(txt);](https://github.com/awillats/circuit-visualizer-p5/blob/1ef9d4fef6f7c2c1b969f6feb4bd9c4726d01e11/sketch.js#L492)
      - try parser in browser
  - ? ? do we need to reimplement? 
      - relies on `nodes[i].name` global, 
      -
    - or just import?
    - is going back from mat -> string easy?

[[ ]] connect UI to parameters
  [ ] discretize delay slider
  (~) noise levels
    (~) gaussian - simple to specify 
    (~) can I easily swap out noise models???
      [x] cycle through noise models rather than picking at random
        - simple global which tracks current noise index
        - increment it when N is pressed
        - [ ] adding dropdown is a bonus 
      (~) main difficulty is having some sense of scale consistent across modes
          (x) write a set_variance() method for each generator
          (-) do we need a different set of slider limits depending on the type? 
            lambda = 5.0 is much bigger than sigma=5.0 ??
        - gaussian: sigma
        - poisson: lambda 
        - multi-poisson: lambda, ( n=100 )
        - perlin: y-scale
      (~) what keys to use? menu box?
   [ ] bound outputs to non-negative if noise-models are Poisson
  [[ ]] buffer length modification
    - may want separate xcorr buffer vs param buffer?
  [ ] clear xcorr buffer on paramter change?
      [x] or on key press?
      - currently, clear buffer on cycling noise mode, but not other params
  (~) weights
    - [x] global slider
    - how to handle individual weight sliders?
  (~) delays
    - [x] global slider
  [ ] mark delays on xcorr

    - implementation of delay doesnt seem to work with non-uniform scaling?
    (x) prove to myself delay impacts the shape of xcorr,
      at least in non-reciprocal circuits
  ðŸ”Š [! !] perhaps want to be able to specify the *output* noise level?
     - or even, variance of signal AND noise
     - see /slides/ for explict prediction of output noise level, ID-SNR

  *to see the impact of params:*
    - ðŸ“… [? ?] show history of xcorr w.r.t buffer length to give a sense of identifiability 
  ! ? would be nice to overlay control directly on the xcorr!


~~~~~~~~~

is there any way to visualize contributions?
- color mixing model?
- plot components?

(? ?) how to measure, export results (so this can be useful quantitatively)

~~~~~~~~~~

[~] XCORR - {compute, normalize, plot}
  ( ) highlight causal lags  
    ( ) also highlight selected square for presentations
      use key combos like `1,2` to highlight A->B
  (! !) quantify instantaneous identifiability
    - coincidence index

  [x] port numpy's other convolution modes to numjs
  [~] plot xcorr (as a function of lags)
    [~] plot all xcorr
      - excise demo code (to demo.js?) to make room for xcorr matrix 
      - increase buffer length
  ( ) plot fixed-lag xcorr
    ( )  add scatterplot to plotFunctions.js
  (!) normalize cross-corr by autocorr
    - plot both normalizations!
    - timeflip as needed

[~] generate strucutral network model 
  ( ) add textbox interface
  ( ) memoize unstable circuits? by saving flag for largest values per circuit
  [~] topological sorted weight matrix
    don't need topo sort if previous state is used for update
  [x] reciprocal conncections can work!  
  (?) figure out adj mat convention from circuit visualizer 

[~] generate signal buffers
  ( ) get sub buffer / view 
  [~] sketch out containers for signals 
	( ) figure out how `circuit-viz` does it

[~] add edittable params
  [ ] use meteor to plot history of parameter
  [x] constrained draggable points
  - fix step increment based on value *not* pixel coordinate
## completed

[~] sketch out GUI elements
  - see google photos
  - container for 2D slider
    - (~) refactor slider as extension of node
    - (~) add additional linear slider

[~] publish & polish
  [x] get gh-pages up
    - enable setting at github, done!
  [~] add basic user guidance
    (~) start with shortcuts panel
      - minimum viable product for this is an explainer paragraph at the bottom
    [~] [mr droob's showcase](https://mrdoob.com/#/112/branching) as inspiration
      he just uses simple text prompt
 
[x] add noise modes
  - ( ) look for qualitative differences
  - (~) add selector
  - [x] perlin
  - [x] gaussian
  - [x] (sum of) Poisson


[x] import basic processing sketch structure
	[x] set folders, helper scripts


## implementaiton notes:
  [x] getValue is based on mouse OR unconstrained coordinates!
    now force position constraint before getting value
[x] add frozen-vs-buffering
[~] import drawWave, Points.js
  - requires gh-pages .io link to act as content-delivery-network
 
--- 

( ) think about theme 
	(~) make sure variables are CSS stylable
