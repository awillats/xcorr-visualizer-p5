# [Cross-Correlation (xcorr) Visualizer](https://awillats.github.io/xcorr-visualizer-p5/)

üöß  Work in progress üöß  
View how correlations between outputs of small networks vary as a function of circuit parameters

Try the [demo here](https://awillats.github.io/xcorr-visualizer-p5/),  
- the default network structure has A delivering input to B, and B delivering input to C (A->B->C)
  - the strength of these connections is set by the weight slider 
  - these connections are delayed according to the delay slider
  - additive noise is injected at each noise, with it's magnitude set by the sliders for each row
- peaks in cross-correlation at negative time-lags can indicate a directional dependence from node i to node j ‚ö†Ô∏è *(causality not guaranteed)* ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - how do parameters such as noise levels impact the clarity of these xcorr peaks?
  - look for peaks in xcorr for connections which aren't in the network
    - how could these be distinguished from "true" direct connections?
- click `controls` to see how to change settings
- consider hitting `c` after major parameter changes to refresh the cross-correlation,
  - otherwise the results will be a mix of the last N samples


## Upcoming Features: üîÆ
- [ ] Computing ["coincidence index"](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0027431) as a measure of connectivity
  - need to verify normalization of cross-correlations
  - highlight significant connections   
  - add axis labels for xcorr lags
- [ ] Edittable circuit structure ( see [circuit-visualizer-p5]()https://github.com/awillats/circuit-visualizer-p5)
  - [x] better visualization of current circuit structure 
- [~] Dropdown menu for noise models
    - for now, cycle through with `n`
- [ ] Edittable buffer length for cross-correlation
- [ ] Exportable quantitative results
- [ ] include autoregressive dynamics
     - for now, Perlin noise setting reasonably approximates nodes with autoregression

## known minor bugs: üêû
- occasional visual glitch with cross-correlations
  - might be related to switching between models/settings?
- Poisson noise model is additive, but doesn't respect non-negativity

## Early observations: üîç 
- finer auto-correlations mean easier connectivity inference
- impact of variances on identifiability depends strongly on...
  - which connection is being examined
  - inputs and outputs to that connection
  - ( *stay tuned for a more general hypothesis on relationship between ground truth structure, variance, and Signal-to-noise ratio for Identifiability* )  
- how you normalize matters more when signals are more different from each other  
  - (i.e. normalizing in reciprocal circuits)
  - buffer lenghts longer than ~2k(5k) significantly slow-down script
      - likely *computing* xcorr not rendering it

- reciprocal circuits with STRONG-ish weights (0.6 < |w| < 1) ...>>
  - circuit was A<=>B->C 
      - w = 0.9, 0.8, -0.7
      - |w| > 1 leads to instability
  - exhibit harmonics in xcorr
      - multiples of base syn. delay
  - also have xcorr mirrored at positive and negative lags
  - harmonics in autocorr bleed over, even into non-recurrent links!
  - longer delays make harmonics easier to separate 
  - resonance may put higher demand on proper normalization
  - inhibitory weights are surprisingly similar to excitatory weights in this setting
- reciprocal circuits with WEAK weights (0.1 < |w| < .6) ...>>
    - confirmed for w = 0.2, 0.4
  - xcorr behaves much more simply, can be interpretted much like non-reciprocal case 

### Simple findings:
- delay has predictable signature on xcorr  
  - (if autocorr is minimal, influence is delta function)

## Repo organization: üóÇÔ∏è
core files / UI:  
- `sketch.js` the heart of the demo
- `index.html` just handles page structure and imports 
- `style.css` sets color scheme and text size 
- `ui-node.js` used for interactive parameter sliders, extends `dragPoints` from [dynamics-visualizer-p5](https://github.com/awillats/dynamics-visualizer-p://github.com/awillats/dynamics-visualizer-p5)  

notes:  
- `README.md` landing page / intro
- `TASKS.md` semi-organized to-do list
- `DEVNOTES.md` unfiltered ramblings about what to do next  

computational methods:
- `signal-generation.js` generates random signals
